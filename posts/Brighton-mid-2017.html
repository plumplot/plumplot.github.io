However, <a href="http://www.homesandproperty.co.uk/property-news/buying/first-time-buyers/house-prices-brighton-is-now-less-affordable-than-london-for-firsttime-buyers-a101001.html">according</a> to Homes&amp;Property, first-time buyers are priced out of 90% of Brighton, which makes it the least affordable city in the whole UK for this group of buyers. The second one, not surprisingly, is London, where more than 50% of properties are out of reach for first-time buyers. </p><p><a href="http://www.lloydsbankinggroup.com/globalassets/documents/media/press-releases/lloyds-bank/2017/250217-affordable-cities.pdf">According</a> to Lloyds Bank’s Affordable Cities Review from February 2017, Brighton is the 6th least affordable city in the whole UK with the price to earning ratio 9.6. Brighton is also the 4th city with the highest house price growth in the past 10 years - the prices grew by 46% between 2007 and 2017. It was surpassed only by St Albans, Winchester, and Chelmsford, which are all in the South East region. </p><p>The most affordable place between July 2016 and June 2017 was "BN21 3" - that is the areas of Eastbourne, Old Town, with the average price of £149.000, around 44% of the average Brighton price and 53% of the England and Wales average property prices. On the other hand, the most expensive post code was 'BN3 6' which covers the areas of Hove, Hangleton, and West Blatchington, with an average price of £688k. The average price of properties in the BN3 6 area is 205% of the average Brighton price and 243% of the average England and Wales prices. <figure><img src="//i.plumplot.co.uk/Brighton-house-prices-map.png" class="img-responsive center-block" alt="Brighton property prices by postcode sector"><figcaption>Fig. 2: Brighton property price map by postcode sector</figcaption></figure></p><p>Between June 2016 and May 2017, the total number of sold properties reached almost 14.400. So what were the most popular properties? A vast majority of all sold properties were established properties. Surprisingly, <a href="/Brighton-new-home-prices.html">newly built properties</a> hold only 7% of total sold properties, despite the fact that there is almost no difference in the prices. The average price of a home is £348k in a newly built property, £336k in an established property. </p><p>The most popular property type were flats with 5000 sold which makes 35% of all sold properties, followed by terraced properties with 3.300 sold and 23% market share, semi-detached and detached houses with 21.5% and 20.5% market share or 3.100 and 3.000 respectively. These ratios, as well as <a href="/Brighton-property-sales.html">sales volumes</a> of newly built and established properties, have been very stable since 1995. </p></div><div class="col-lg-12 space text-center"><a href="/Brighton-house-prices.html"><h3>Latest Brighton house prices</h3></a><div class="col-lg-12 space"><a href="http://www.plumplot.co.uk"><svg class="svg" xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 450 610 570"><g><path d="m391.75 455.4-22.168 0.12248 2.1433 68.709-72.2-48.317 1.286 38.274 231.54 153.58c11.73 0.16794 23.695-2.4043 16.595-25.046l-154.55-103.35-2.64-83.96zm-99.02 20.09-248.44 167.73c-6.8887 20.736 6.6898 25.356 16.595 25.046l232.46-153.65-0.61-39.13zm-166.63 160.5-27.925 21.372v274.77h27.006l0.91857-296.15zm340.97 0 0.91856 296.15h27.006v-274.77l-27.924-21.372zm-384.26 301.29c-3.7781 4.6541-5.5741 9.3082 0 13.962h427.56c3.1488-3.6045 6.0734-7.2837 0-13.962h-427.56z"/><text x="150" y="800" font-family="Verdana" font-size="99">Home</text></g><metadata><rdf:RDF><cc:Work><dc:format>image/svg+xml</dc:format><dc:type rdf:resource="http://purl.org/dc/dcmitype/StillImage"/><cc:license rdf:resource="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/publicdomain/"/><dc:publisher><cc:Agent rdf:about="http://openclipart.org/"><dc:title>Openclipart</dc:title></cc:Agent></dc:publisher><dc:title>eco green house icon</dc:title><dc:date>2012-05-29T15:40:56</dc:date><dc:description/><dc:source>https://openclipart.org/detail/170282/eco-green-house-icon-by-cybergedeon</dc:source><dc:creator><cc:Agent><dc:title>dominiquechappard</dc:title></cc:Agent></dc:creator><dc:subject><rdf:Bag><rdf:li>ecology</rdf:li><rdf:li>green</rdf:li><rdf:li>home</rdf:li><rdf:li>house</rdf:li><rdf:li>icon</rdf:li></rdf:Bag></dc:subject></cc:Work><cc:License rdf:about="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/publicdomain/"><cc:permits rdf:resource="http://creativecommons.org/ns#Reproduction"/><cc:permits rdf:resource="http://creativecommons.org/ns#Distribution"/><cc:permits rdf:resource="http://creativecommons.org/ns#DerivativeWorks"/></cc:License></rdf:RDF></metadata></svg></a></div></div></div><div class="container spacem"></div><hr><footer class="footer"><div class="col-lg-offset-2 col-lg-8"><h4><small> Datasource: <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/statistical-data-sets/price-paid-data-downloads">Price Paid Data</a> .
